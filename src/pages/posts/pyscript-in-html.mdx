## What is PyScript?
> PyScript is a framework that allows users to create rich Python applications in the browser using HTML's interface and the power of Pyodide. The PyScript framework provides users at every experience level with access to an expressive, easy-to-learn programming language with countless applications.
## Installation
**There is two options to install PyScript**
[Download source Zip-File](https://pyscript.net/)
Copy code tag to your html file
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/latest/pyscript.css" />
<script defer src="https://pyscript.net/latest/pyscript.js"></script>
```
## Using in real project?
> Please be advised that PyScript is very alpha and under heavy development. There are many known issues, from usability to loading times, and you should expect things to change often. We encourage people to play and explore with PyScript, but at this time I do not recommend using it for production.
## Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Hello, PyScript!</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.css" />
  <script defer src="https://pyscript.net/alpha/pyscript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <py-script>print("Hello, World!")</py-script>
</body>
</html>
```
