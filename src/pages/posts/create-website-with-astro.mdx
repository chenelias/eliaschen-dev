## Why Astro

1. 1.Built page more faster with [_Markdown_ and _MDX_](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).
2. 2.Support a variety of [UI-Dramework and SSR Adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).

## Installation

> **Run these command to create your astro project.**

```shell
# for yarn
yarn create astro
# for npm
npm create astro@latest
# for pnpm
pnpm create astro@latest
```

After run the command,the CLI will asked you

-   **&bull;&thinsp;projectname(project flodername)**
-   **&bull;&thinsp;Template(I recommend to choose _Blog_)**
> **The other question just choose recommend**

**Finally you can use the your `package-Manager Name`+`start` command to start run your project.**

## What I built with Astro

**In fact this WebSite was built with astro([eliaschen.dev](/)).**
