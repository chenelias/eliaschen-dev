## Why Astro

1. 1.Built page more faster with [_Markdown_ and _MDX_](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/).
2. 2.Support a variety of [UI-Dramework and SSR Adapters](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/).

## Installation

**> Run these command to create your astro project.**

<script src="https://gist.github.com/chenelias/0bf05e5e84dc31502388d634376e9660.js"></script>

! After you run the command,the CLI will asked you

-   **projectname(flodername)**
-   **Template(I recommend to choose _Blog_)**
    <p class="text-red-500 font-bold">! The other question just choose recommend</p>

**Finally you can use the your `package-Manager Name`+`start` command to start run your project**

## what I built with Astro
**In fact this WebSite was built with astro([eliaschen.dev](/)).**
